# BSG_classifier_builder
Train locally fine-tuned bird sound recognition models.

This repository contains the codes for training the bird sound classification models described in "Bird Sounds Global - model builder: An end-to-end workflow for building locally fine-tuned bird classifiers" and example scripts for analyzing new data with the models will be added here.

Folder Train BSG models contains codes for preprocessing and the training data and training the classification models. The training data is not currently publicly available but will be published once all necessary permissions are obtained. Following large files are here either missing or truncated but will be published along with the data:
irmatrix/irmatrix.mat
BirdNet_results/all_birdnet_results.csv

The trained classifiers and codes for evaluating the models and running them on new data will be published under folder Run BSG models.
